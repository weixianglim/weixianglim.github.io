                Currently an undergraduate in DigiPen Institute of Technology (Singapore)
                pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science in Real-Time Interactive Simulation,
                I have a deep passion for developing games and applications.<br><br>
                Even though I'm mainly specialized in C++, I'm equally passionate
                about other programming aspects and languages.
                For instance, I've crafted this very webpage from scratch with HTML / CSS / JavaScript!
                I'm also fairly well versed in commercial game engines like Unity3D.<br>

                    MindOverMatter is a 2D-puzzle platformer built from scratch on a custom 2D game engine. You play as a protagonist possessing the ability to
                    freely toggle between 3 states - Solid, Liquid, and Gas. Each state allows you to maneuver through different environmental obstacles while
                    providing you with unique skills and abilities. Being the technical lead for the project, I handled the majority of the engine, gameplay, 
                    graphics and scripting codes while also managing the delegation of programming tasks. I was also the co-producer and acted as the bridge between the technical team and designers.
                    The project was developed over the course of 2 semesters and was an arduous process overall. I was particularly proud of the tilemap system and
                    the amount of polish we've put into the game towards the Gold/Shipping phase. In the end, all the hardwork was well worth the effort
                    as MindOverMatter was nominated for (and won!) multiple awards.<br><br>

                    FishieProtecc is a fast-paced game which will strain the players reaction speeds and planning abilities. 
                    It is my freshman project in DigiPen and was nominated for Gumi Asia's Best Freshman Game award. I was the technical lead for this project and
                    handled most of the engine, graphics, scripting and gameplay codes. We were given a framework to deal with the graphics and windows creation of 
                    the game, but I decided to take the challenge of using OpenGL and freeglut instead. This was a project consisting of a small team of 4 programmers without dedicated
                    artists or designers. Despite that, I am extremely proud of the overall look and game design of the end product.<br><br>

                    games designed by neuroscientists to improve attention, memory and other cognitive skills. During my time as an intern, I had the chance to not only
                    work on part of the current UI system, but also developed a full minigame. I also had the chance to try out Neeuro's SenzeBand hardware first-hand and it was
